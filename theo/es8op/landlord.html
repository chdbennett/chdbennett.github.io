<h2> Landlords </h2>
Landlords run the gamut.  Some of our landlords
are corporate owners with offices in midtown Manhattan.  Others
are local owners who may own a building or two with a hundred units
or more.  At the other end of the spectrum we have the widow living
alone who finds
her family home more than she can cope with, so she moves out and
rents the house.  Any person with an available apartment or house is a
potential landlord with ESOP.
<p> Do you need any previous experience? No.  All that's required is a
willingness to provide the standard services contracted for in a lease and
dictated by normal landlord/tenant relationships.
<p> In most cases ESOP can meet the prevailing market rent.  
Where we find an especially good apartment with superior amenities,
in a good location, we have often been able to obtain a rent exception, 
allowing up to 20% more than HUD's published "fair market rent" (FMR) guidelines.  
A large portion of the monthly rent is guaranteed, because it comes to the landlord
directly from the Section 8 Program at the first of each month.
<p> Under Section 8 the landlord has the following rights
<ul>
<li> Complete freedom of tenant selection, consistent with
fair housing law.
<li> A full month's security deposit from new tenants.
<li> The right to evict a tenant for lease violations. (Such a tenant
may also be terminated from the Section 8 Program, which serves as a powerful
incentive to abide by the lease.)
<li> The right not to renew the lease at the end of its term.
<li> A landlord is no longer required to rent to Section 8 tenants in the future
just because he/she has done so in the past.
</ul>
