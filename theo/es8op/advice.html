<h2> Advice for setting up a Housing Outreach Office </h2>
<p> The population we serve is predominantly black and hispanic, with less than 50% of the area median household income.
Small families (e.g. a mother with one or two children) are most common, but we serve a fair number of single people, two-parent families, and a few families with four or more children.  About a
third of our heads of household have jobs, some are in job training programs, and some are unemployed. Besides the Section 8 subsidy, most of our clients receive food stamps and Medicaid, and some receive WIC, Social Security (survivors, disability and SSI), child support, and public assistance.  
<p> LANDLORD OUTREACH is important. Landlords
outside slum neighborhoods typically know little about Section 8.  Personal visits by our staff have helped build landlords' confidence in the practicallity and advantages of the program for them.  Good experiences with the first Section 8 tenant paved the way for future tenants, especially in multi-unit properties.
<p> Attracting prospective tenants is no problem, probably because of our convenient downtown location.  A steady stream of people walk into our office off the street, including some we can't help because they don't have Section 8 subsidies. These we refer
to the local Section 8 office, where they face a years-long waiting
list unless they are lucky enough to be in an emergency situation,
such as having been burned out of their former home.
<p> TENANT SUPPORT is absolutely essential, before, during, and after the move.  Although we have been
described as a real estate office for the poor, our staff helps tenants in many other ways.  We accompany them to see prospective housing and landlords, help them find the bus routes they need to get to jobs and other appointments in communities where most people have private cars, accompany them to enroll their kids in new schools and put them in contact with day care, summer camp, and other services in the new community.  Most of all, we give them moral support and encouragement that they can succeed in the new community, despite the apprehension many feel at being racially and economically unlike their new neighbors. Within a few months,
most tenants are comfortable in their new locations.
<p> We have found it invaluable to have the pro bono help of an
expert in social services law and regulations. He helps
the tenants negotiate the social service bureaucracy, obtaining moving expenses, security deposits, and other benefits and 
adjustments they need in order to make the move, but which are not automatically forthcoming from social service agencies.
