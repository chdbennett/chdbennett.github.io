<h2> Section 8 </h2>
The Section 8 program is a federal rent subsidy program operated by the
Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in Washington D.C.  HUD channels
funds to states; states distribute the funds to housing authorities at the county,
state and local levels.  Those agencies award the funds to people who apply 
and demonstrate that they qualify based on need and household income.
A person who qualifies can be issued a CERTIFICATE or a VOUCHER---a document 
with the participant's name and an indication of the size rental unit the 
participant is authorized to look for.  It is tangible evidence 
that the housing authority has found the subsidy holder eligible and that it 
will guarantee a large portion of the rent due on any acceptable 
apartment the participant chooses to rent.  Unfortunately in many areas 
there is a large backlog of people who would meet the income and need 
guidlines, but who have been put on a waiting list.
Many local authorities are no longer even accepting applications.
