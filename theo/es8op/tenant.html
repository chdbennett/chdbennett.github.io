<h2> Tenants </h2>
Our clients are Westchester residents who mirror the population in most ways, except that their incomes are too low for them to afford reasonable housing.  With a Section 8 subsidy, the tenant pays a maximum of 30% of household income as rent.  Typically that income is from wages, Social Security (retirement, survivors benefits, disability or SSI), child support payments, and/or public assistance.
<p> ESOP works closely with a legal expert who evaluates the needs 
of each family to determine
what programs are available to help them access education/training 
and employment opportunities, as
well as the child care that may be needed to help 
them to take advantage of these opportunities.  
ESOP also helps qualifying clients obtain help with moving expenses 
and security deposits.
<p>Under Section 8, the tenant is obligated to:
<ul>
<li> Supply proof of citizenship or legal immigrant status.
<li> Promptly notify Section 8 of an eviction notice.
<li> Give Section 8 notice of intent to move or terminate lease.
<li> Get Section 8 approval to add people to the household, unless by birth, adoption, or court order.
<li> Give prompt notice whenever someone moves out.
<li> Use the apartment as the family's only home.
<li> Repay any money owed to the Section 8 Program.
<li> Notify Section 8 of any change in job status or family income.
</ul>
