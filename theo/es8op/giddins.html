<h2>  Giddins v. HUD, et al. 91 Civ. 7181 (RPP) </h2>
A class-action lawsuit brought by Section 8 subsidy holders living in Southwest 
Yonkers against the local Section 8 program, and the state and federal programs,
alleging that the Section 8 office had steered minority section 8 holders into 
apartments in segregated and crumbling neighborhoods.  The Federal Fair Housing 
Act requires that federally funded agencies actively promote racial integration.
The suit alleged that the existing Section 8 programs:
<ul>
<li> had no landlord outreach.
<li> did not tell tenants that they could use their subsidies in
other neighborhoods.
<li> did not assist them with tools such as rent exceptions, and set the
payment standard so low as to limit tenants' ability to move into
integrated neighborhoods 
</ul>
<p> 
Under the Consent Decree in 1993 the defendants agreed to fund the Enhanced
Section 8 Outreach Office to redress the grievances of the plaintiffs.
The rent subsidy programs of the Yonkers Municipal
Housing Authority and the Westchester County Planning Department have
cooperated with ESOP as we work to expand housing opportunities for
minority families.
