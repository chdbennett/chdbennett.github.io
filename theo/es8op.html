<p>Our program helps low-income holders of <a href="es8op/section8.html">Section 8 </a>rent subsidies to find housing in economically and racially mixedneighborhoods. It grew out of a settlement to a class-action suit<a href="es8op/giddins.html"> Giddins v. HUD (1991) </a>alleging that existing Section 8 programs had systematically steeredtenants into economically blighted, racially segregated neighborhoods, andhad failed to inform and assist them in exercising their freedom ofchoice of where to live. The Enhanced Section 8 Outreach Program of Yonkers (ESOP) provides services to both landlords and tenants toenable them to fulfill this mandate under federal Fair Housing law.</p>
<h3>How is ESOP different from a regular Section 8 office? </h3>
<p>A regular Section 8 office administers rent subsidies to tenants whoqualify based on their income. ESOP helps tenants who already haveSection 8 subsidies optimize the subsidies so that they can getmore for their housing dollar. As advocates for our landlords, we workto make sure they get good tenants and the highest rents for which theyare eligible under the Section 8 Program. Our emphasis is on assistingtenants to move into integrated neighborhoods with good schools and jobopportunities. We stay in close touch with tenants and landlords tokeep their relationship mutually satisfactory, assisting with anyproblems that arise. The only thing we don't do that a regular Section8 office does is issue the certificates and vouchers that embody thesubsidies.</p>
<h3>Our Philosophy </h3>
<p>Our office is located near the people we serve, in the Getty Square neighborhoodin southwest Yonkers, New York State, a vibrant but blighted area. Our neighborsinclude a Probation Office, a Social Security Office, Housing Court,a police station, the Health Department, but few businesses offeringstable employment. This is an environment in which it is easy for people to remain dependent on various social services,and hard to find jobs. We believe our clients have the rightto decent housing, in a safe neighborhood, with goodschools, city services, and job opportunities. We have found that most of our clients rapidly move into jobs or job training programs once they move into areas where jobs are available. </p>
<p>The area schools have been described by the New York Times(Dec 28, 1995) as "Neither Separate nor Equal," meaning that acertain amount of school racial integration has been achieved withoutsignificant improvement in the quality of education. A disproportionate number of our tenants' children have been identified by the schools as being learning-disabled. One of themost heartening experiences of our program is to see the kidsrespond and flourish when they go from an overcrowded, dilapidatedschool into one where teachers have the time and energy to focus on the individual talents and needs of the students. We expectthat the biggest beneficiaries of ESOP will be the children.</p>
