<img src="../bennetc/piperb.JPG" height="110" width="83">Rarely
outside of a large city can one find a school to compare with the
Bennett
Conservatory of Music, either in variety of instruction available, the
superior qualifications of the teaching staff, or the cultural
activities
sponsored by the school for the students, their families, and the
community.
This brochure attempts to outline what the Conservatory has to offer,
but
it cannot adequately convey the atmosphere of friendliness,
informality,
enthusiasm, and dedication in which this instruction takes place. It
can
only imply some of the unique advantages to the student which such a
school
can offer - the chance to see and hear such a variety of artistic
efforts,
to take part in coordinated artistic projects, to know that one's own
lesson
is a small but significant part of a group effort to make life richer
through
the enjoyment and the disciplines of art.
