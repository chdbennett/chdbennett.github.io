BIOGRAPHY of CHARLES H. BENNETT July 2005
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles H. Bennett was born in
1943, the son of music
teachers Anne Wolfe Bennett and Boyd Bennett. He
graduated from Croton-Harmon High School in 1960 and
from Brandeis University, majoring in chemistry, in 1964. He
received his PhD from Harvard in 1970 for molecular dynamics
studies (computer simulation of molecular motion) under David
Turnbull and Berni Alder. For the next two years he continued
this research under the late Aneesur Rahman at Argonne Laboratory.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since coming to IBM Reseach in
1972, he has worked on various
aspects of the relation between physics and information. In 1973,
building on the work of IBM's Rolf Landauer, he showed that
general-purpose computation can be performed by a logically and
thermodynamically reversible apparatus, which can operate with
arbitrarily little energy dissipation per step because it avoids
throwing away information about past logical states; and in 1982 he
proposed a reinterpretation of Maxwell's demon, attributing its
inability to break the second law to the thermodynamic cost
of destroying, rather than acquiring, information. In collaboration
with Gilles Brassard of the University of Montreal he developed a
practical system of quantum cryptography, allowing secure
communication between parties who share no secret information
initially, based on the uncertainty principle instead of usual
computational assumptions such as the difficulty of factoring, and
with the help of John Smolin built a working demonstration of it in
1989. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other research interests include
algorithmic information
theory, in which the concepts of information and randomness are
developed in terms of the input/output relation of universal
computers, and the analogous use of universal computers to define the
intrinsic complexity or "logical depth" of a physical state as the
time required by a universal computer to simulate the the evolution of
the state from a random initial state. In 1983-5 as visiting professor
of computer science at Boston University, he taught courses on
cryptography and the physics of computation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993 Bennett
and Brassard, in collaboration with Claude Crepeau, Richard Jozsa,
Asher Peres, and William Wootters, discovered "quantum teleportation,"
an effect in which the complete information in an unknown quantum
state is decomposed into purely classical information and purely
non-classical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations, sent
through two separate channels, and later reassembled in a new
location to produce an exact replica of the original quantum state
that was destroyed in the sending process. In 1995-7, working with
Smolin, Wootters, IBM's David DiVincenzo, and other collaborators, he
helped found the quantitative theory of entanglement and introduced
several techniques for faithful transmission of classical and quantum
information through noisy channels, part of the larger and recently
very active field of quantum information and computation theory.
Recently
he has worked on the capacities for quantum channels and interactions
to simulate one another and the tradeoffs among communications
resources.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is an IBM Fellow, a Fellow of
the American Physical Society, and a member of the National Academy of
Sciences.
He is married with three grown children. His wife, Theodora M.
Bennett, recently retired from directing a housing mobility program in
Yonkers. His main hobbies are photography and music.
