An apparently well-formed English phrase with no meaning.</h2>

first appears to refer to 1,101,121 (one million, one hundred one thousand,
one hundred twenty one), but on closer examination is not name of any number,
because if it were, that number would be nameable in nine words.&nbsp;

<td><font size="+1">English is noteworthy for its ability to create arbitrarily
long chains of nouns, each modifying the next.&nbsp; When a noun chain
bites its tail, the result is a loop that can have infinitely many slightly
different meanings, depending on where one starts and stops and how many
times one goes around the loop.&nbsp; For example, if a "toll house cookie"
is a type of cookie served at toll houses,&nbsp; a "toll house cookie delivery
truck toll house cookie" is a more specialized type of cookie served at&nbsp;
toll houses where tolls are collected from trucks delivering ordinary toll
house cookies.</font>
