<span style="font-weight: bold;">Title: </span>A Simple Proof of the Threshold for 
Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>
One of the central critical results in the theory of fault-tolerant
quantum computation is that arbitrarily long reliable computation is
possible provided the error rate per gate and per time step is below
some threshold value.  This was proved by a number of groups, but the
detailed published proofs are complex and furthermore only hold for
concatenation of quantum error-correcting codes able to correct 2 errors
per block, while typically the best estimates of the threshold value are
based on the 7-qubit code, which only corrects 1 error per block.  I
will describe recent work by Panos Aliferis, John Preskill, and myself
which substantially simplifies existing proofs and applies as well to
the concatenated 7-qubit code.  The new proof also provides a nice
framework in which to attempt to prove relatively high values of the
threshold, which so far have only emerged as estimates from simulations
of fault-tolerant circuits.

Complexity in near-neighbor quantum computers<br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span> We will discuss
fault-tolerant architectures, related thresholds, and algorithmic
complexity as they relate to near-neighbor quantum computers.  In
particular, we will discuss the computation of a threshold for
fault-tolerant quantum computation in near-neighbor architectures, and
also address the complexity issues involved in implementing quantum
algorithms (e.g., the factorization algorithm).

<a name="svore">Krysta Svore</a><br> <span style="font-weight:
bold;">Title:</span> Local fault-tolerant quantum computation<br> <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span> We analyze and
study the effects of locality on the fault-tolerance threshold for
quantum computation. We analytically estimate how the threshold will
depend on a scale parameter r which estimates the scale-up in the size
of the circuit due to encoding. We carry out a detailed semi-numerical
threshold analysis for concatenated coding using the 7-qubit CSS code
in the local and `nonlocal' setting. First, we find that the threshold
in the local model for the [[7,1,3]] code has a 1/r dependence, which
is in correspondence with our analytical estimate. Second, the
threshold, beyond the 1/r dependence, does not depend too strongly on
the noise levels for transporting qubits. Beyond these results, we
find that it is important to look at more than one level of
concatenation in order to estimate the threshold and that it may be
beneficial in certain places, like in the transportation of qubits, to
do error correction only infrequently.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Title: </span>Fault-tolerant quantum
dynamical decoupling<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>We have recently
introduced time-concatenated dynamical decoupling
pulse sequences. Numerical and analytical results show that these
pulse sequences are remarkably robust against both systematic and
random control errors, thus exhibiting a rudimentary form of
fault-tolerance. They super-polynomially outperform standard, periodic
dynamical decoupling pulse sequences at equal cost, in the
non-Markovian regime in which they apply. I will describe these
results (with Kaveh Khodjasteh) in this talk. Time permitting, I will
also present very recent results (with Robert Alicki and Paolo
Zanardi) that point to possible internal inconsistencies in the
fundamental assumptions entering into the theory of fault-tolerant
quantum error correction for Markovian noise.

threshold for concatenated distance-2 codes<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>
I will present joint work with Daniel Gottesman and John
Preskill for obtaining a proof of the threshold theorem that applies
to concatenated error-detecting codes. This proof, in conjunction with
the post-selected fault-tolerant architecture recently introduced by
Knill, will allow us to establish rigorous lower bounds on the
threshold for adversarial stochastic noise of the order of 10^{-3}.

for optical quantum computers<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>
I shall report on the joint work with Christopher Dawson and
Michael Nielsen, to find the noise threshold for optical quantum computing.
We are considering the recent proposal for combining aspects of the original
KLM linear-optical scheme with that of the cluster-state model of quantum
computation. I will describe how one may go about designing an efficient
optical cluster-state error-correction protocol that is resistant to the
combined effects of photon loss, qubit depolarisation, and inherent
nondeterminism of two-qubit interactions. Threshold results based on
numerical simulations will be given.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Title: </span>Fault-tolerant architecture for quantum 
computation using electrically controlled semiconductor spins<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>
Recently, coherent manipulation of solid-state quantum bits,
analogous to well developed realisations in atomic physics, was
experimentally demonstrated. However, achieving fault tolerant
quantum computation entails significant mitigation of environmental
couplings, which is particularly challenging in the solid-state. We
develop a scalable architecture for solid-state quantum computation
based on actively protected two electron spin states in quantum dots.
Specifically, we find a universal set of gates for two-spin states
that can be implemented using only local electrical control, with
explicit suppression of hyperfine interactions, the dominant source
of error. The architecture allows for a modular, hierarchical design,
and includes autonomous control and non-local coupling using
controlled electron transport. We present detailed analysis of
quantum error correction for this architecture, and find that fault-
tolerant operation appears to be achievable with present experimental
methods and parameters.  <p>The work presented is part of a
collaboration with H.-A. Engel (Harvard), W. Duer (Innsbruck), A.
Yacoby (Weizmann), C. M. Marcus (Harvard), and P. Zoller (Innsbruck).

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Title:</span> Accuracy threshold and architecture for 
trapped-ion quantum computers<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>
Recent experiments have demonstrated the required elements for
quantum computing with trapped atomic ions. I will present a
fault-tolerant system architecture that integrates these elements.
The architecture is based on an array of linear traps through which
ions move ballistically. Timescales for movement, gates, and
measurement are related to physical limits. Networks using the
[[7,1,3]] code are layed out to reduce communication distance and
idle time. Finally, I will present an accuracy threshold for this
architecture.

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>Using symmetries 
inherent in the [[7,1,3]] code and circuitry
used to perform fault-tolerant computation, I demonstrate how to calculate
the exact error distribution in an erasure error model using Markov chains.
This approach, although complex, can be automated and is an
alternative to Monte Carlo simulation if the code and circuits have enough
symmetry.

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>Invoking the notion
of composable simulation, we provide a
very
simple proof why fault-tolerance and threshold analysis in graph state
quantum computation require no extra technique beyond those required for
the standard model. Lower bounds for the threshold thus follow from
existing results.
