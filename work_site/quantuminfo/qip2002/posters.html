</i>Experimental realization of the entanglement enhanced quantum games</h3>
Many previous works on quantum games are based on maximally entangled state.
In this letter, we investigate the role of entanglement in quantum games.
For the particular case of the quantum Prisoners' Dilemma, the property
of the game changes fascinatingly with the variation of the measure of
the game's entanglement. Furthermore this quantum game is experimentally
realized on our nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer.

</a></i>Readout of a single electron spin based quantum bit by current
detection</h3>
We present theoretical and experimental results demonstrating the read-out
of a single and coupled spin based quantum bits by current detection. The
quantum bits were built by isolating a single or coupled spin complexes
in single and coupled lateral dots with a tunable number of electrons.
The spin state of these dots was read from the current amplitude resulting
from the injection of spin polarized electrons. The current amplitude showed
a systematic dependence on the spin state of the dots controlled by the
number of electrons.

</i>Quantum Automata and Probabilistic Reversible Automata</h3>
This is joint work together with Maksim Kravtsev. To study relationship
between quantum automata and probabilistic automata, we introduce definition
of probabilistic reversible automata (PRA). These automata use doubly stochastic
matrices for their transition function. We prove, that similarly to quantum
case, these automata cannot recognize language (a,b)*a. In general, PRA
cannot recognize languages violating partial order condition. We also prove
that PRA can recognize such languages as a*b* with probability 1-e. An
immediate consequence is that quantum automata with mixed states (model
of Nayak) recognize a*b* with probability 1-e.

Decoherence rates of spatial electron states in semiconductor quantum dots
due to interaction of electrons with deformational acoustical and piezoacoustical
phonons were obtained. It is shown that such structures based on GaAs substrate
can be coherent enough to perform fault tolerant computations.

</a></i>Entanglement in quantum computation</h3>
We investigate numerically and anlytically the entanglement in pure states
of N qubits both generally and in specific states during the operation
of Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer. We find that in typical pure
states of N qubits, subsets obtained by partial tracing have positive partial
transpose (separable or no free entanglement) if they are smaller than
N/3 qubits. This result holds generally for states of N qudits (d-dimensional
particles). In Shor's algorithm we find numerically that, while entanglement
is present in the states generated during computation, the amount (measured
as the entropy of subsystems in bipartite splits) is only very weakly correlated
with the success or failure of the result (Shor s algorithm is probabilistic).
We discuss the implications these results may have for the role of entanglement
in the speed up of quantum computation over classical.

</a></i>Continuous quantum error correction via quantum feedback control</h3>
We describe a protocol for continuously protecting unknown quantum states
from decoherence that incorporates design principles from both quantum
error correction and quantum feedback control. Our protocol uses continuous
measurements and Hamiltonian operations, which are weaker control tools
than are typically assumed for quantum error correction. We develop a cost
function appropriate for unknown quantum states and use it to optimize
our state-estimate feedback. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study our
protocol for the three-qubit bit-flip code in detail and demonstrate that
it can improve the fidelity of quantum states beyond what is achievable
using quantum error correction when the time between quantum error correction
cycles is limited.

</i>Universal Quantum Computing Operations with Asymmetric Anisotropic
Exchange Interaction</h3>
The asymmetric anisotropic exchange interaction is explored to generate
universal unitary operations on suitably encoded quantum information. The
algebraic approach, recently developed and applied for isotropic and symmetric
anisotropic exchange, is employed to construct a complete set of encodings
of a logical qubit from three physical qubits. Then, the exchange interaction
Hamiltonian suffices to generate the complete su(2) algebra over a single
logical qubit. The non-trivial two-qubit gates are constructed using suitably
timed conjugating operations. The total number of operations needed to
implement the controlled-Z gate up to local transformations is five. An
appropriate scalable architecture is proposed.

</i>Simulating Hamiltonians in Quantum Networks: Efficient Schemes and
Complexity Bounds</h3>
We address the problem of simulating pair-interaction Hamiltonians in n
node quantum networks where the subsystems have arbitrary, possibly different,
dimensions. We show that any pair-interaction can be used to simulate any
other by applying sequences of appropriate local control sequences. Efficient
schemes for decoupling and time reversal can be constructed from orthogonal
arrays. Conditions on time optimal simulation are formulated in terms of
spectral majorization of matrices characterizing the coupling parameters.
Moreover, we consider a specific system of n harmonic oscillatorswith bilinear
interaction. In this case, decoupling can efficiently be achieved using
the combinatorial concept of difference schemes. For this type of interactions
we present optimal schemes for inversion.

</i>A comparaison between the violation of Bell inequalities and the entanglement
of formation for mixed states of two qubits</h3>
We identify all mixed states of two qubits with maximal and minimal violation
of the Bell inequalities for given entanglement of formation. It is shown
that a whole class of entangled mixed states does not violate any CHSH
inequality, even if SLOCC (filtering) operations are allowed before the
measurments.

Quantum Communications Security (QCOMSEC)</h3>

of communications systems that rely on quantum key distribution to achieve
secrecy. This framework is an extension of the standard framework used
to analyze the security of classical cryptosystems.

</i>On the role of coherent attack in a type of strategic problem wit quantum
key destribution</h3>
Since Bennett and Brassard suggested their quantum ke distribution protocol(BB84
protocol) in 1984,the subject has been extensively studied both theoretically
and experimentlly. The protocol allows two remote parties Alice and Bob
to create and share a secrect key using a quantum channel and public authenticated
communications. The quantum key created in this way is generally believed
to be secure in principle because eavesdroppers have no way to tap the
quantum channel without disturbing it. In particular, BB84 protocol has
been proven to be unconditionally secure after the error correction and
privicy amplification recently. Besides the BB84 protocol, a number of
other protocols have been proposed recently. In the security evaluation,
evesdropper$'$s strategy to obtain the maxium information given the disturbance
to the qubits is often studied. For this strategy, the optimized individual
attack have been extensively constructed under various conditions. However,
it seems a difficult task in the case of coherent attack, i.e., Eve may
treat a number of intercepted qubits collectively, including the collective
unitary transformations and the measurements. In this paper we give a general
conclusion on the role of coherent attacks for the strategy of maxmizing
the information given the disturbance. Suppose in a quantum key distribution(QKD)
protocol, all the transmitted bits from Alice are independent and only
the individual disturbances to each qubits are examined by Alice and Bob.
For this type of protocols( so far almost all QKD protocols belong to this
type), in principle no coherent attack is more powerful than the product
of optimized individual attack to each individual qubits. All coherent
attacks to the above QKD protocols can be disregarded for the strategy
above.

</i>An algebraic approach to quantum cryptography and quantum communication</h3>
We present an algebraic approach for describing the impact of a measurement
process on the state of a quantum system. It is inspired by the theory
of quantum statistical mechanics and quantum dynamical systems. The central
notion is that of partition of unity which models the measurement apparatus.
This leads to a quantum statistical description of the state of the system
after measurement. The uncertainty about this state can then be expressed
in terms of quantum entropy. We apply our construction to quantum cryptography
and show that natural results are obtained and that noise can easily and
in a natural way be embedded. We also derive an upper bound on the average
amount of information that can be transmitted through a quantum channel
per unit of time.

</i>Structured quantum search using the density of states</h3>
In the multitarget Grover algorithm, we are given an unstructured N-element
list of objects S_i containing a T-element subset tau and function f, called
an oracle, such that f(S_i)=1 if S_i is in tau, otherwise f(S_i) = 0. By
using quantum parallelism, an element of tau can be retrieved in O(sqrt(N/T))
steps, compared to O(N/T) for any classical algorithm. It is shown here
that in combinatorial optimization problems with N=4^M, the density of
states can be used in conjunction with the multitarget Grover algorithm
to construct a sequence of oracles that structure the search so that the
optimum state is obtained with certainty in O(log(N)) steps.

</a></i>Quantum finite state transducers</h3>
We introduce quantum finite state transducers (qfst), and study the class
of relations which they compute. It turns out that they share many features
with probabilistic finite state transducers, especially regarding undecidability
of emptiness (at least for low probability of success). However, like their
`little brothers', the quantum finite automata, the power of qfst is incomparable
to that of their probabilistic counterpart. This we show by discussing
a number of characteristic examples.

generalizes many basic scenarios in quantum information theory, from cloning
and quantum error correction to the recently-discovered phenomenon of nonlocality
without entanglement. We determine the achievable rate region for some
important special cases, give bounds in others, and shake our heads at
some curious representatives of the general case. (Joint work with Andrew

Suppose Alice wants to perform some computation that could be done quickly
on a quantum computer, but she cannot do universal quantum computation.
Bob can do universal quantum computation and claims he is willing to help,
but Alice wants to be sure that Bob cannot learn her input, the result
of her calculation, or even the function she is trying to compute. We describe
an efficient protocol by which Bob can help Alice perform the computation,
but there is no way for him to learn anything about it. Furthermore, we
show how Alice can efficiently detect whether Bob is honestly helping her
or if he is introducing errors.

``cnot'' Gate.</h3>
In this paper, we propose a new direction of research for the realization
of the quantum controlled-not gate based on a technique called ``interaction-free
measurement'', where qubits are two-level atoms (or ions) and information
is mediated from one qubit to another by lasers in superpositions of $\pi$
and $2\pi$ pulses. We investigate the advantages and limitations of such
a gate and discuss possible applicability.

</i>Recovery, Super-Catalysis, and classification of entanglement in Bi-Partite
Pure-state Transformations</h3>
We present a comprehensive set of results pertaining to properties of bipartite
and pure-state entanglement transformations in the finite-copy regime.
For example, we show for the first time that the entanglement lost in transformations
of comparable bipartite pure states can be almost always recovered by performing
a joint transformation with an auxiliary entangled state of dimension 2X2.
Similarly, we show that transformations between incomparable states, can
be not only enabled by using auxiliary states (catalysis), but that lost
entanglement can be simultaneously recovered (leading to supercatalysis).
A final set of results show how the notions of comparability and incomparability
of states can be generalized and extended to the case where a finite number
of copies of states are available. (Joint work with Somshubhro Bandyopadhyay)

</i>Is it possible to clone using an arbitrary blank state?</h3>
Quantum information cannot be cloned. But although exact cloning is not
possible, one can approximately clone an arbitrary input state. In this
scheme a fixed state is taken as the blank state depending on which, the
cloning machine is constructed. Now the quality of the clones could be
badly affected if the blank state gets changed to an unknown state, say
by some environment-induced decoherence. We show that by suitably constraining
the unitary operator, it is possible to keep the clones intact, even in
this changed scenario where one has an arbitrary blank state. We show that
this effect holds for both deterministic as well as probalilistic exact
cloning. We hope that this work would help in a possible experimental implementation
of quantum cloning.

</i>On communication over an entanglement-assisted quantum channel</h3>
Shared entanglement is a resource available to parties communicating over
a quantum channel, much akin to public coins in classical communication
protocols. Whereas shared randomness does not help in the transmission
of information, or significantly reduce the classical complexity of computing
functions (as compared to private-coin protocols), shared entanglement
leads to startling phenomena such as ``quantum teleportation'' and ``superdense
coding.'' The problem of characterising the power of prior entanglement
has puzzled many researchers. We revisit the problem of transmitting classical
bits over a noiseless entanglement-assisted quantum channel. We derive
a new, optimal bound on the number of quantum bits required for this task,
for any given probability of error. This gives an alternative proof of
optimality of the superdense coding scheme of Bennett and Wiesner, and
improves over the previous lower bound due to Cleve, van Dam, Nielsen,
and Tapp. All known lower bounds in this setting are based on sophisticated
information-theoretic arguments. In contrast, our result is derived from
first principles, using a simple linear algebraic technique. (Joint work

</i>On the class of languages recognizable by quantum automata</h3>
It is an open problem to characterize the class of languages recognized
by quantum finite automata (QFA). We examine some necessary and some sufficient
conditions for a (regular) language to be recognizable by a QFA. For a
subclass of regular languages we get a conditions which are necessary and
sufficient. For arbitrary regular language, we only know that these conditions
are necessary but do not know if all languages satisfying them can be recognized
by a QFA. We also determine the maximum probabilities achieved by QFAs
for several languages. In particular, we show that any language that is
not recognized by an RFA (reversible finite automaton) can be recohnized
by a QFA with probability at most 0.7726.. .

</i>How few qubits do we need?</h3>
While it is known that Shor's algorithm requires polynomial time, the minimal
number of qubits it needs is not known. By putting together several tricks,
we provide circuits for factorization on a quantum computer using few qubits.
So far, to factor an n-bit number, the best circuits we have are one with
2n+3 qubits and O(n3 log n) elementary quantum gates, and one with 3n+2
qubits and O(n3) gates.

Probabilistic reversible and quantum automata</h3>
Joint work with Marats Golovkins (University of Latvia) We offer new notion
of probabilistic automata namely probabilistic reversible automata (PRA).
We prove that this model is stronger than the deterministic reversible
automaton model, and show that it preserves similar restrictions as quantum
automata in one-way case but acts differently in one-and-half and two-way
case. Basic results about PRA are the following. Forbidden construction
for one-way PRA is shown. Recognition of languages' conjunction and disjunction
is shown. Language (a|b)*a is considered and proved impossible to be recognized
by one-way PRA, but possible by one-and-half PRA.

Computational model underlying the one-way quantum computer</h3>
Authors: R. Raussendorf and H. J. Briegel
<br>We demonstrated in [1] that a class of highly entangled multi-particle
states, the cluster states [2], can serve as one-way quantum computers.
The one-way quantum computer is a scheme of universal quantum computation
that consists only of one-qubit measurements on the resource quantum state.
The one-way quantum computer has the property that any quantum logic network
can be simulated on it. Conversely, not all ways of information processing
that are possible with the one-way quantum computer can be explained within
the network model. For example, all circuits in the Clifford group -- which
contains for example many coding circuits -- can be performed in a single
time-step. On the other hand, the network realization requires a number
of time steps logarithmic in the number of logical qubits. Thus, the description
of the one-way quantum computer in network terms is not adequate in every
respect. A computational model [3] underlying the one-way quantum computer
is presented. [1] R. Raussendorf and H. J. Briegel, A one-way quantum computer.

Ambainis-Freivalds' Algorithm for Measure-Once Automata</h3>
An algorithm given by Ambainis and Freivalds constructs a quantum finite
automaton (QFA) with O(log p) states recognizing the language L_p={a^i|i
is divisible by p} with probability 1-epsilon, for any epsilon &gt; 0 and
arbitrary prime p. However, the Ambainis-Freivalds algoritm is tailored
to constructing a measure-many QFA, which cannot be implemented on existing
quantum computers. In this paper we modify the algorithm to construct a
measure-once QFA and give examples of parameters for this automaton. We
show for the language L_p that a measure-once QFA can be twice as space
efficient as measure-many QFA's.

Entnaglement Breaking Channels</h3>
Three classes of stochastic maps, or channels, are considered, (1) those
of the so-called Holevo form $\Phi(\rho) = \sum_k R_k ~ \tr \, F_k \rho$
where each $R_k$ is a denisty matrix and the $\{F_k\}$ form a POVM, (2)
those for which $(I \ot \Phi)(\Gamma)$ is always separable, and (3) those
which satisfy a certain sign change condition which,in the case of qubits,
is equivalent to the condition that composition with the transpose is also
completely positive. We show that, in the case of qubits, these three classes
of channels coincide and that any channel of this form can be written as
a convex combination of CQ and point channels. In particular, we prove
that any qubit channel whose image lies within a plane is in this class
and, hence, entanglement breaking. The relations between these classes
of maps is discussed for general d-bit channels.

Information-theoretic Approach to Adaptive Dyne Measurements</h3>
We propose a new approach to adaptive "dyne" measurements of quantum optical
fields, which is based on maximization of the mutual information between
the photocurrent record and the measured variable. Depending on the nature
of the measured ensemble of field states, the scheme is shown to selectively
perform phase, quadrature, amplitude or other, more general measurements.
In the case of phase measurements, the scheme apparently always extract
more or as much information about the phase as Wiseman’s scheme [Phys.
Rev. A 56 944 (1997)].
