<h2>Quantum Teleportation</h2>
Teleportation is the name given by science fiction writers to the feat
of making an object or person disintegrate in one place while a perfect
replica appears somewhere else. How this is accomplished is usually not
explained in detail, but the general idea seems to be that the original
object is scanned in such a way as to extract all the information from
it, then this information is transmitted to the receiving location and
used to construct the replica, not necessarily from the actual material
of the original, but perhaps from atoms of the same kinds, arranged in
exactly the same pattern as the original. A teleportation machine would
be like a fax machine, except that it would work on 3-dimensional
objects
as well as documents, it would produce an exact copy rather than an
approximate
facsimile, and it would destroy the original in the process of scanning
it. A few science fiction writers consider teleporters that preserve
the
original, and the plot gets complicated when the original and
teleported
versions of the same person meet; but the more common kind of
teleporter
destroys the original, functioning as a super transportation device,
not
as a perfect replicator of souls and bodies.
<p><img  alt="Six scientists" hspace="10" height="238" width="293" align="right">In 1993 an international group of six
scientists, including IBM Fellow
Charles H. Bennett, confirmed the intuitions of the majority of science
fiction writers by showing that perfect teleportation is indeed
possible
in principle, but only if the original is destroyed. In subsequent
years, other scientists have demonstrated teleportation experimentally
in a variety
of systems, including single photons, coherent light fields, nuclear
spins, and trapped ions.&nbsp; Teleportation promises to be quite
useful as an information processing primitive, facilitating long range
quantum communication (perhaps unltimately leading to a "quantum
internet"), and making it much easier to build a working quantum
computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; But science fiction
fans will be disappointed to learn that no one expects to be able to
teleport
people or other macroscopic objects in the foreseeable future, for a
variety
of engineering reasons, even though it would not violate any
fundamental
law to do so.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>In the past, the idea of teleportation was not taken very seriously
by scientists,
because it was thought to violate the uncertainty principle of quantum
mechanics, which forbids any measuring or scanning process from
extracting
all the information in an atom or other object. According to the
uncertainty
principle, the more accurately an object is scanned, the more it is
disturbed
by the scanning process, until one reaches a point where the object's
original
state has been completely disrupted, still without having extracted
enough
information to make a perfect replica. This sounds like a solid
argument
against teleportation: if one cannot extract enough information from an
object to make a perfect copy, it would seem that a perfect copy cannot
be made. But the six scientists found a way to make an end run around
this
logic, using a celebrated and paradoxical feature of quantum mechanics
known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect. In brief, they found a way
to scan out part of the information from an object <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>, which one wishes
to teleport, while causing the remaining, unscanned, part of the
information
to pass, via the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect, into another object <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>
which has<img  alt="figure" hspace="10" height="403" width="480" align="left">
never been in contact with <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>.
Later, by applying to <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> a
treatment
depending
on the scanned-out information, it is possible to maneuver <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> into
exactly
the same state as <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> was in
before it was scanned. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>
itself is no longer
in that state, having been thoroughly disrupted by the scanning, so
what
has been achieved is teleportation, not replication.
</p>
<p>As the figure to the left suggests, the unscanned part of the
information
is conveyed from <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> by an intermediary object <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span>, which interacts
first
with <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> and then with <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>. What? Can it really be correct to
say "first
with
<span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> and then with <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>"? Surely, in order to convey
something from <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>,
the
delivery vehicle must visit <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>
before <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>, not the other way
around. But
there
is a subtle, unscannable kind of information that, unlike any material
cargo, and even unlike ordinary information, can indeed be delivered in
such a backward fashion. This subtle kind of information, also called
"Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
(EPR) correlation" or "entanglement", has been at least partly
understood
since the 1930s when it was discussed in a famous paper by Albert
Einstein,
Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen. In the 1960s John Bell showed that a
pair of entangled particles, which were once in contact but later move
too far apart to interact directly, can exhibit individually random
behavior
that is too strongly correlated to be explained by classical
statistics.
Experiments on photons and other particles have repeatedly confirmed
these
correlations, thereby providing strong evidence for the validity of
quantum
mechanics, which neatly explains them. Another well-known fact about
EPR
correlations is that they cannot by themselves deliver a meaningful and
controllable message. It was thought that their only usefulness was in
proving the validity of quantum mechanics. But now it is known that,
through
the phenomenon of quantum teleportation, they can deliver exactly that
part of the information in an object which is too delicate to be
scanned
out and delivered by conventional methods.

<p><img  alt="figure" hspace="10" height="343" width="480" align="left">This figure compares conventional facsimile
transmission with quantum teleportation
(see above). In conventional facsimile transmission the original is
scanned,
extracting partial information about it, but remains more or less
intact
after the scanning process. The scanned information is sent to the
receiving
station, where it is imprinted on some raw material (eg paper) to
produce
an approximate copy of the original. By contrast, in quantum
teleportation, two
objects
<span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> are first brought into contact and
then separated. Object <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span> is
taken to the sending station, while object <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> is taken to the receiving
station. At the sending station object <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span>
is scanned together with the
original
object <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> which one wishes to
teleport, yielding some information and
totally
disrupting the state of <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span>. The scanned information is sent
to the
receiving station, where it is used to select one of several treatments
to be applied to object <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>,
thereby putting <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> into an
exact replica of
the
former state of <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>.
